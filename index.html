                        If you want to become a fancy gunslinger, then the Red Dead Online Bounty Hunter role should
                        appeal. You'll unlock various gun spinning tricks as you rank up by bringing in wanted
                        criminals, as
                        well as additional weapons such as bolas and a reinforced lasso to help you restrain tough
                        targets.
                        Bounties can be acquired from boards near post offices, railway stations, and law offices, with
                        greater
                        rewards available for felons you bring back alive, and you can also tackle the weekly Red Dead
                        Online
                        Legendary Bounties. Once you hit role rank 12, you'll also get the opportunity to apprehend
                        other online
                        players with a bounty of $20 or more, by following an invite if a pursuit is happening nearby.

                    If hunting is your game, then taking on the Red Dead Online Trader role is the next logical step.
                    Working alongside Cripps at your camp, you'll rank up by harvesting pelts and carcasses for
                    materials, which your trusty companion will then convert into sellable goods. You'll need to send
                    out these goods as safe local deliveries or riskier long distance runs, and as you progress you'll
                    unlock better delivery wagons and improved security measures to protect your camp from raids.
                    Levelling up will also make you a more efficient hunter, allowing you to harvest and carry an
                    increased amount of materials.
